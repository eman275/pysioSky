      'The maturity amount of the policy is the expected amount to be available in your investment account at the end of the insurance period. This is an approximate value and does not necessarily guarantee reaching this amount, as it will depend on the future performance of investment funds. The final value may be the same, higher, or lower. Therefore, these figures are for illustrative purposes only. 	',

    quote_ques_title_4: 'What is the Sum Covered? ',
    quote_ques_desc_4:
      'The Sum Covered is the amount due in the event of death. Depending on the product you will purchase, it determines how the accrued value will be used in the event of the death of the covered person. In investment and retirement products, upon death, the beneficiaries receive the amount in the investment account or the protection amount, whichever is higher. In products for children (education or marriage), the insurance company pays the subscription value until the end of the policy through the protection amount. So the beneficiary receives the value of the policy maturity at the end of the insurance period without being affected by the death of the covered person.',
    quote_ques_title_5: 'What is the Illustration file? ',
    quote_ques_desc_5:
      'It is a file containing an explanation of how your investment is expected to grow during the term of the policy. It shows for each year of the policy the value of the deducted expenses, the expected value of your investment account in that year, and the recovery value if you cancel the policy during any of its years. According to the rules regulating the Central Bank, the explanation must contain an explanation of the investment at the expected values based on growth rates of 3%, 5%, and 7%. Please note that these are just illustrative values only. But it is impossible to predict what will happen in the future as any investment has risks.',
